TL;DR;


PURPOSE OF THE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK
This Employee Handbook is intended to help you become acquainted with some important policies and practices of Saleae, Inc. (hereinafter the “Company,” or “Saleae, Inc.”).

All employees are expected to read and sign the acknowledgement form at the end of this Handbook stating that you understand its contents.
From time to time, the information included in our Employee Handbook may change.

The Company will keep you informed of changes through suitable lines of communication.
Nothing in this Employee Handbook, or any other document describing personnel policies or benefit plans, creates or is intended to create a contract, promise or representation of continued employment, or continued terms and conditions of employment, for any employee.
This Handbook replaces all earlier handbooks and supersedes all prior inconsistent policies, practices, and procedures.  
This Handbook is generally based upon federal laws and California state laws.  Some policies may not apply to employees based outside of California.  As to each employee, the Company will comply with the laws of the jurisdiction where the employee is located.  Please contact Human Resources with any question as to the applicability of any policy outside of California.

# EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES & POLICIES

## At-Will Employment
Employment with Saleae, Inc. is voluntarily entered into, and the employee is free to resign at will at any time, with or without cause.  Similarly, Saleae, Inc. may terminate the employment relationship at will at any time, with or without notice or cause.
Policies set forth in this handbook are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations of any kind or a contract of employment between Saleae, Inc. and any of its employees.  The provisions of the handbook have been developed at the discretion of management and, except for its policy of employment-at-will, may be amended or cancelled at any time, at Saleae, Inc.’s sole discretion.  The at-will policy may be changed only in a writing signed by the Chief Executive Officer.

## Equal Employment Opportunity
It is Saleae, Inc.’s policy to provide equal employment opportunity for all applicants and employees. The Company does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, religion, religious creed (includes all aspects of religious belief, observance, and practice, including religious dress and grooming practices), color, national origin (including language use restrictions), ancestry, physical and mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, denial of family and medical care leave, marital status, sex (which includes pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding and medical conditions related to pregnancy), gender, gender identity, gender expression, sex stereo type, transgender, age (40 and over), military and veteran status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, registered partner status, and any other local, state, or federal protected basis.  When necessary, the Company also makes reasonable accommodations for disabled employees and for pregnant employees who request an accommodation, with the advice of their health care providers, for pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.
The Company prohibits sexual harassment and the harassment of any individual in any of the areas listed above. For information about the types of conduct that constitute impermissible harassment and the Company’s internal procedures for addressing complaints of harassment, please refer to the Company’s Sexual & Other Unlawful Harassment policy in Section V of this handbook.
This policy applies to all areas of employment including recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, benefits, transfer, disciplinary action, and social and recreational programs. It is the responsibility of every manager and employee to conscientiously follow this policy. Any employee having questions regarding this policy should discuss them with Human Resources.

## Business Ethics and Conduct
Saleae, Inc. will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its directors, officers and employees to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.
Compliance with this policy of business ethics and conduct is the responsibility of every Saleae, Inc. employee.  Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of business ethics and conduct could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment.

## Personal Relationships in the Workplace
Relatives of present employees may be hired by the Company only if: (1) the individuals concerned will not work in a direct managerial relationship with one another; and (2) the employment will not pose difficulties for supervision, security, safety, or morale.  
"Relatives" are defined as spouses, domestic partners, children, sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, cousins, nieces, nephews, uncles, aunts, grandparents, grandchildren, and persons related by marriage.  
Present employees who marry or become domestic partners or who become related by marriage will be permitted to continue employment with the Company only if they do not work in a direct managerial relationship with one another, or otherwise pose difficulties for supervision, security, safety, or morale.  If employees who marry or who become related by marriage do work in a direct managerial relationship with one another, the Company will attempt to reassign one of the employees to another position for which he or she is qualified, if such a position is available.  If no such position is available, then one of the employees will be required to leave the Company. The decision as to which employee leaves will be left solely to the employees.  In the event that no alternative position is available and neither employee voluntarily leaves the Company, the Company will determine in its discretion which employee to terminate based on legitimate business needs.

## Conflicts of Interest
Employees are expected to devote their best efforts and attention to the full-time performance of their jobs. Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest.  A conflict of interest exists when the employee's loyalties or actions are divided between the Company’s interests and those of another, such as a competitor, supplier, or customer. Both the fact and the appearance of a conflict of interest should be avoided. Employees unsure as to whether a certain transaction, activity, or relationship constitutes a conflict of interest should discuss it with their manager or Human Resources for clarification.  Transactions with outside companies must be conducted within a framework established and controlled by the executive level of Saleae, Inc.  Business dealings with outside companies should not result in illicit or unethical gains.  Illicit or unethical gain refers to bribes, product bonuses, special fringe benefits, unusual price breaks, and other unauthorized windfalls. Exceptions to this guideline must be approved in writing by the CEO of the Company.

If an employee or someone with whom an employee has a close relationship (e.g., a family member or close companion) has a financial or employment relationship with a competitor, customer, supplier, or potential supplier, the employee must disclose this fact in writing to the employee’s manager or Human Resources.  While it is not feasible to describe all possible conflicts of interest that could develop, some of the more common conflicts that employees should avoid include the following:

- Accepting personal gifts or entertainment from competitors, customers, suppliers, or potential suppliers;
- Working for a competitor, supplier, or customer;
- Engaging in self-employment in competition with the Company;
- Using proprietary or confidential Company information for personal gain or to the Company's detriment;
- Having a direct or indirect financial interest in or relationship with a competitor, customer, or supplier, except that ownership of less than one percent (1%) of the publicly traded stock of a corporation will not be considered a conflict;
- Using Company property or labor for personal use;
- Acquiring any interest in property or assets of any kind for the purpose of selling or leasing it to the Company;
- Committing the Company to give its financial or other support to any outside activity or organization; or,
- Developing a personal relationship with a subordinate employee of the Company or with an employee of a competitor, supplier, or customer that might interfere with the exercise of impartial judgment in decisions affecting the Company or any employees of the Company.

Failure to adhere to this guideline, including failure to disclose any conflicts or to seek an exception, may result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment.

## Outside Employment
During the term of an employee’s employment by Saleae, Inc., except on behalf of the Company, an employee may not directly or indirectly, whether as an officer, director, shareholder, partner, associate, representative, consultant, or in any capacity whatsoever, engage in, become financially interested in, be employed by or have any business connection with any competitor, supplier, or customer of Saleae, Inc.

## Non-Disclosure
The protection of confidential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and the success of Saleae, Inc.  Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:  Compensation data, computer processes, computer programs and codes, customer lists, customer preferences, financial information, labor relations strategies, marketing strategies, new materials research, pending projects and proposals, proprietary production processes, research and development strategies, scientific data, scientific formulae, scientific prototypes, technological data, technological prototypes.

All employees are required to sign and comply with an agreement protecting confidential information and trade secrets as a condition of employment.  Employees who improperly use or disclose trade secrets or confidential business information will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and legal action, even if they do not directly benefit from the disclosed information.

## Employment Categories
Each employee is designated as either non-exempt or exempt from certain federal and state wage and hour laws.  Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay for hours worked under the specific provisions of federal and state laws.  Exempt employees are excluded from specific provisions of federal and state wage and hour laws and will not be paid overtime pay.  Exempt employees are expected to work additional time without extra pay when necessary, consistent with the nature of their position and job duties.

Additionally, to determine eligibility for various benefits, employees of the Company are classified as regular full-time, regular part-time, or temporary employees as follows:

“Regular Full-Time employees” are those who are hired on a full-time basis for an indefinite or unspecified duration who are regularly scheduled to work at least forty (40) hours per week.  Regular full-time employees are eligible for all Company-sponsored employee benefits, subject to individual plan requirements for eligibility.

“Regular, Part-Time employees” are those who are hired on a part-time basis for an indefinite or unspecified duration,  and who are regularly scheduled to work less than forty (40) hours per week.  Regular part-time employees who are regularly scheduled to work at least thirty (30) hours per week are eligible for all benefits accorded regular full-time employees (pro-rated where applicable). Regular part-time employees who are regularly scheduled to work fewer than thirty (30) hours per week are not eligible to participate in Company-sponsored benefits, other than those required by state and/or federal law. Please contact the Human Resource Department for specific information regarding this.

“Temporary employees” are those who are hired as interim replacements, to temporarily supplement the work force, to assist in the completion of a specific project, or for any other kind of work with the understanding that such work will be completed within a specified period of time.  Employment assignments in this category are of a limited duration.  Employment beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in employment status.  Temporary employees retain that status unless and until notified of a change in writing by Human Resources.  Temporary employees are not eligible for Company-sponsored benefits, other than those required by state and/or federal law.  

## Access to Personnel Files
Saleae, Inc. maintains a personnel file for each employee.  Employees have the right to inspect their personnel files at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice. In addition, employees have the right to request copies of all employment-related documents that they have signed. An employee may inspect only his or her own personnel file and only in the presence of a Human Resources representative.  Personnel files are the property of the Company and may not be removed from the Company’s premises without written authorization from Human Resources.
## Employment Reference Checks
It is the policy of Saleae, Inc. to check the employment references of all applicants.

Saleae, Inc. may also perform background checks on applicants prior to any offer of employment.

All requests for information from employee files and inquiries from outsiders, including requests for job references concerning current or former employees, should be promptly directed to the Human Resources Department. The Human Resources Department is the only source authorized to provide information of any kind regarding current or former employees. The Company’s policy as to references is to disclose only the dates of employment and position(s) held.  If the employee provides advance written authorization, the Company may also disclose the employee’s salary or wage.  Additional information will only be provided if required by law.

## Personnel Data Changes
It is the responsibility of each employee to promptly notify Saleae, Inc. of any changes in personnel data, including personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, numbers and names of dependents, and individuals to be contacted in the event of an emergency.

## Employment Applications and Other Employment-Related Communications
Saleae, Inc. relies upon the accuracy of information presented throughout the hiring process and during employment.  Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in information may result in the exclusion of the individual from further consideration for employment or, if the person has been hired, termination of employment.

## Performance Reviews
Managers and employees are strongly encouraged to discuss job performance and goals on a regular and informal basis.  Additional formal performance evaluations are conducted to provide both managers and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct weaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting goals.

Formal reviews are scheduled approximately every twelve (12) months in January. At the discretion of the employee’s manager, these reviews may occur on a more frequent basis. Formal reviews will include a written performance evaluation on the manager’s or employee’s current social and environmental goals.

Merit-based pay adjustments and/or performance bonuses may be awarded by Saleae, Inc., in its sole discretion, in an effort to recognize truly superior employee performance.  The decision to award such an adjustment is dependent upon numerous factors, including the information documented by the formal performance evaluation process.

## Employment Termination
Saleae, Inc. will generally schedule exit interviews at the time of employment terminations.  The exit interview will afford an opportunity to discuss such issues as employee benefits programs, conversion privileges, and repayment of outstanding debts to Saleae, Inc., continuing obligations to the Company and return of Saleae, Inc.-owned property.  Suggestions, complaints, and questions can also be voiced at the exit interview.  Since employment with Saleae, Inc. is at-will, both the employee and Saleae, Inc. have the right to terminate employment at any time, with or without cause or notice.  Employees will receive their final pay in accordance with applicable law.

# COMPENSATION & BENEFITS

## Holidays
Saleae, Inc. provides paid holiday time off to eligible employees on the eleven (11) assigned holidays listed below:
- New Year’s Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving Day
- Day after Thanksgiving
- Christmas Eve
- Christmas Day
- New Year’s Eve

Normally, a recognized holiday that falls on a Saturday, may at the Company’s discretion, be observed on the preceding Friday.  A recognized holiday that falls on a Sunday, may at the Company’s discretion, be observed on the following Monday.  In the event Saleae, Inc. elects to grant additional Company holidays, Company Management or the Human Resources Department will provide written notification of such to all eligible employees.
Regular full-time employees and regular part-time employees regularly scheduled to work at least thirty (30) hours per week are eligible for holiday pay.  Temporary employees and employees regularly scheduled to work fewer than thirty (30) hours per week are not eligible for holiday pay.  Employees are not eligible for holiday benefits that accrue while on an unpaid leave of absence.  

Eligible full-time employees will receive time off with pay at their normal base rate for each Company-observed holiday. Eligible part-time employees will receive pro-rated holiday pay based on their regularly scheduled hours.  Part-time employees not scheduled to work on a holiday are not eligible for holiday pay.

The Company may, in its discretion, require employees to work on scheduled holidays and provide pay in lieu of time off.  Non-exempt employees required to work on a Company-observed holiday will be paid their normal base rate for all hours worked, plus holiday pay.

In addition to the recognized holidays listed above, eligible employees who started on or before June 30 of each year will receive two days that the Company provides for professional development. Eligible employees who start on or after July 1 during a calendar year, will be entitled to one day for professional development.  Professional Development Days must be scheduled in advance, with the prior approval of the employee’s manager, and verification, such as a syllabus or certificate.  Unused Professional Development Days will not be carried over at year-end.

## Vacation
All regular full-time employees and regular part-time employees regularly scheduled to work at least thirty (30) hours per week are eligible for vacation benefits.  Temporary employees and employees who are regularly scheduled to work fewer than thirty (30) hours per week are not eligible for vacation benefits.

Eligible employees accrue vacation on a monthly basis starting on the date of hire, and they can request use of vacation after it has been accrued.  Full-time employees accrue up to fifteen (15) days of vacation per year.  Eligible part-time employees accrue vacation on a pro-rated basis based on the number of their regularly scheduled hours of work.   
Employees may accrue up to a total amount of unused vacation until it reaches a “cap” equal to 160 hours (20 days), at that time further accrual will stop.  When the employee uses vacation and brings the accrued amount below the cap, accrual will begin again until the cap is reached.

No vacation accrues during an unpaid leave of absence or while on disability salary continuation. Vacation accruals recommence when the employee returns to work.

To schedule planned vacation, employees must request advance approval from their manager using the PTO Request form available on the Zenefits website (www.zenefits.com). Saleae, Inc. will make reasonable efforts to allow employees to take PTO for the time requested, but such requests may be denied at the Company’s sole discretion.  

Vacation is paid at the employee’s current base pay rate at the time the vacation is taken.  It does not include overtime or any special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials.  Vacation hours taken will not be counted as hours worked for the purpose of determining overtime.

Vacation may be used to supplement any payments that an employee is eligible to receive from state disability insurance or workers’ compensation while the employee is on leave for illness or injury.  Any vacation the employee elects to use will be considered with any such other compensation or benefits for which the employee may be eligible, so that the employee does not receive more than one hundred percent (100%) of his or her regular pay.

Upon termination of employment, employees will be paid for any accrued, unused vacation at the employee's base rate of pay at the time of his or her termination.

## Sick Leave
Employees will accrue one hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked (including overtime hours). Employees who are exempt administrative, executive, or professional employees accrue sick time based on the employee's normal work week or a 40-hour work week, whichever is less.  Employees may begin using any accrued sick leave on their 90th day of employment, provided they have worked in the state of California for 30 or more days.

Sick leave will continue to accrue until you reach a cap of 72 hours (or nine days) in each year of employment.  The sick leave will be "compensated at the same wage as the employee normally earns during regular work hours.”    

Similar to California's requirements related to vacation accrual, the company will allow employees to carry over all accrued paid sick days to the following year of employment. Paid sick time will continue to accrue until it reaches a maximum cap of 72 hours (or nine days) and may carry over to the next year.  

### Permitted Uses
Employees are allowed to use the 72 hours of paid sick time per year on the employee's oral or written request for the following reasons:

For his or her own qualifying need, or for that of a "family member," for:
- Diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition; or
- Preventative care.
Employees can also use additional sick time if:
- The employee is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
Employees must use sick leave in one (1) hour increments.

### Cash-Out
As per California law, the Company will not cash out employee's accrued, but unused, paid sick time at the end of employment.

### Employee Notice

We will provide sick leave upon an employee's oral request. However, if the need for sick time is foreseeable, you must provide a reasonable advance notification. If the sick time is unforeseeable, an employee must provide the Company with notice of the need to use sick time as soon as practicable. At this time, the Company will not be asking for supporting documentation unless sick leave is in association with an extended leave of absence or a work injury.  However, we reserve the right to revise this policy as business needs and regulations change.

## Overtime
From time to time, it may be necessary for employees to perform overtime work.  The Company provides compensation for all overtime hours worked by non-exempt employees in accordance with federal and state law.  Non-exempt employees must accurately record all time worked, including those hours worked beyond their normal schedule.  Employees will be notified of their eligibility for overtime pay at their time of hire, at the time their job duties and position changes or otherwise as appropriate. 

All overtime by non-exempt employees must be approved in advance by their manager. Unauthorized working of overtime may be subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment. When it is necessary to work overtime, employees are expected to cooperate as a condition of their employment.

All non-exempt employees based in California will receive time and a half their regular rate for overtime hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in a single workday or more than forty (40) hours in any one workweek and for the first eight (8) hours worked on the seventh consecutive day in any one workweek.  Double time will be paid for hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any workday and for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours on the seventh consecutive day worked in any one workweek.  Non-exempt employees based outside of California will be paid overtime in accordance with the requirements of applicable federal and state laws.

For purposes of calculating overtime for non-exempt employees, the workweek is defined as starting at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday and ends at 12:00 midnight the following Saturday.  The work day is defined as the 24-hour consecutive period beginning at 12:01 a.m. each day and ending 24 hours later at 12:00 midnight.  

Only those hours that are actually worked are added together to determine an employee’s overtime pay.  Compensated holidays, PTO, and sick leave for example, are not hours worked and, therefore, are not counted in making overtime calculations.  

## Rest & Meal Periods
Non-exempt employees working at least three and one-half hours in a day are authorized and permitted to take a ten-minute rest period for each four hours worked or a major fraction thereof, which should generally occur mid-morning and mid-afternoon on a normal eight-hour work day.  Rest breaks are paid time.  

Non-exempt employees who work longer than five (5) hours will be provided an unpaid meal period of at least thirty (30) minutes. The meal period schedule may vary among departments, depending on the needs of each department, but must commence prior to the end of the fifth hour of work. Your manager will determine the meal period schedule.  Non-exempt employees whose work period exceeds ten (10) hours will be provided a second unpaid meal period of at least thirty (30) minutes. Non-exempt employees should not perform any work duties during their meal periods and are relieved of all active work requirements.

Non-exempt employees are expected to record their assigned working hours and the time allowed for meal periods. It is the employee’s obligation to ensure that rest and meal periods are taken in accordance with this policy. A non-exempt employee who is unable to take a rest or meal period during any workday must notify their manager immediately.

## Timekeeping
Accurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every non-exempt employee.  Federal and state laws require Saleae, Inc. to keep an accurate record of time worked in order to calculate employee pay and benefits.  All non-exempt employees must record when they start and end work, including at the beginning and ending of their work on a particular day. The time record should also reflect absences, such as PTO or sick days.  Employee time records are used to prepare paychecks. If you make a mistake in your time record, you should report the error to your manager immediately. Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording time on another employee’s time record may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

## Paydays  
All employees are paid semi-monthly on the 15th of each month and the last day of each month.  In the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a weekend or holiday, paychecks will be distributed on the preceding workday.
Employees may have their pay directly deposited into their bank accounts if they provide advance written authorization to Saleae, Inc. Please see Human Resources or Payroll for a direct deposit authorization form. Employees will receive an itemized statement of wages when Saleae, Inc. makes direct deposits.

## Pay Advances
Saleae, Inc. does not provide pay advances on unearned wages to employees.

## Pay Deductions
The law requires that Saleae, Inc. make certain deductions from every employee’s compensation.  Among these are applicable federal, state, and local income taxes.  Saleae, Inc. also must deduct amounts under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA – Social Security and Medicare) and amounts for any state disability insurance (SDI).  
Eligible employees may voluntarily authorize deductions from their paychecks to cover the costs of participation in certain benefits programs, such as health insurance coverage.  Employees who want to change the number of their exemptions for federal or state income tax withholding purposes should notify the Human Resources Department.

## Other Benefits
Upon completion of a thirty (30) day waiting period the Company provides benefits for eligible employees, as described in general terms below. The terms on which benefits are made available to employees are set forth in the governing plan documents. In the event of a conflict between the following descriptions and the terms of the plan documents, the plan documents will control. This handbook is not a plan document and does not create any enforceable rights with respect to benefits or otherwise. The Company reserves the right to eliminate or modify any of its benefits at any time without prior notice.

### Worker’s Compensation Insurance
Saleae, Inc. provides insurance at no cost to employees for any work-related injuries or illness. Subject to applicable legal requirements, workers’ compensation insurance generally provides benefits after a short waiting period.

Employees who sustain work-related injuries or illnesses should inform their manager immediately. This will enable an eligible employee to qualify for coverage as quickly as possible.

### Health Insurance
Saleae, Inc.’s health insurance plan provides all regular full-time employees and regular part-time employees who are regularly scheduled to work at least thirty (30) hours per week, and their dependents access to medical, dental, and vision insurance benefits.  Employees are responsible for the cost of twenty-five percent (25%) of their own insurance premium and fifty percent (50%) of their dependents’ insurance premium.  Qualified employees are eligible for medical, dental, and vision insurance coverage starting the first day of the month following their thirty (30) day waiting period.  Dependents may be added within thirty (30) days of a birth, marriage or adoption or at the annual open enrollment.  

### Benefits Continuation (Cal-COBRA)
The California Continuation Benefits Replacement Act of 1997 (Cal-COBRA) requires insurance carriers and HMOs to provide COBRA-like coverage for employees of smaller companies. Under Cal-COBRA, the group health plan carrier must offer each qualified beneficiary (the employee and any covered dependents) who would otherwise lose coverage under the plan as a result of a qualifying event an opportunity to continue their insurance coverage. A qualifying event is defined as termination of employment or reduction in hours of employment, death of covered employee, divorce or legal separation, a dependent child ceases to be dependent, for dependents only, eligibility of the covered employee for Medicare, or an employer’s bankruptcy.  An employee has opportunity to choose to continue coverage directly through the insurance carrier. The employer notifies both the employee experiencing the qualifying event and the insurance carrier. Provided the employee elects to continue coverage, the insurance carrier then assumes the responsibility of coverage instead of the employer.

### State Disability Insurance
At this time, Saleae, Inc. does not provide short-term or long-term disability plans.

However, state sponsored programs provide for temporary disability benefits for employees unable to work because of disability due to a non-occupational accident or illness. These programs are financed through deductions from each employee's taxable earnings and through employer contributions as established by law in each particular state. Benefits are not automatic. Employees must complete the required form to receive benefits.

### 401(k) Savings Plan
Saleae, Inc. has established a 401(k) savings plan (traditional and Roth) for all regular full-time and part-time employees.  To be eligible to participate in the 401(k) savings plan, employees must be employed by Saleae, Inc. for three (3) months and be twenty-one (21) years of age or older.  Once the third month of employment at Saleae, Inc. is complete, employees may elect to join the 401(k) savings plan at any time.  The 401(k) savings plan allows employees to elect how much of their salary they want to contribute, up to the IRS maximum allowed amount, and direct the investment of their plan account, so they can tailor their own retirement package to meet their individual needs. Saleae, Inc. matches up to 4% of the gross salary wages.

### Flexible Spending Account
Saleae, Inc. provides a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) program that allows regular full-time employees and regular part-time employees who are regularly scheduled to work at least thirty (30) hours per week to have pre-tax dollars deducted from their salaries to pay for eligible out-of-pocket expenses.  The pre-tax contributions made to the FSA can be used to pay for certain non-reimbursed, IRS qualified, health care expenses and dependent care expenses during the plan year.  Through the FSA program, employees can reduce their taxable income without reducing their real income, so that they can keep more of the money they earn.

Participation in the Health Care and/or Dependent Care FSA is optional and determined on an annual basis for the plan year.  Eligible employees may enroll immediately upon hire (up to 30 days after start date) for a deduction to be made from their first paycheck.  Employees must re-enroll for each plan year each December.  Employees determine how much to contribute to the account, up to a specified maximum, based on an individual’s anticipated expenses during the plan year.  Currently, employees may contribute up to a maximum of $2,500 each year for their Health Care FSA.  The maximum contribution for employees’ Dependent Care FSA is currently $5,000 per year.  Contributions are directed to the account through salary deduction on a pre-tax basis.  This tax-free money is then available to employees for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses.  Since the amounts that remain in the account at the end of the plan year (March 15th of the following year) are forfeited, employees should take care not to over-fund their account. 

### Commuter Check Program
Saleae, Inc. currently participates in the Commuter Check program (www.commutercheck.com).  Commuter Checks are vouchers that employers give employees to ride public transit.  Employees are able to take advantage of an IRS tax code provision allowing them to deduct up to $125 per month from their salary on a pre-tax basis (additional amounts can be added as post-tax deductions).  Commuter Checks can be used to purchase tickets and passes for any public transit service.  Employees who wish to take advantage of the Commuter Check program should contact the Human Resources Department for enrollment information.

# HEALTH, SAFETY AND SECURITY IN THE WORKPLACE

## Safety  
Each employee is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities.  Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition or injury to his or her manager or the Human Resources Department.  Employees who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.  In compliance with California law, and to promote the concept of a safe workplace, the Company maintains an Injury and Illness Prevention Program.

## Smoking
Smoking is prohibited throughout the workplace.  This policy applies equally to all employees, customers, visitors and all others on Saleae, Inc.’s premises.

## Emergency Closings
At times, emergencies such as severe weather, fires, power failures, or earthquakes, can disrupt Company operations.  In extreme cases, these circumstances may require the closing of a work facility.

When the decision to close is made after the workday has begun, employees will receive official notification from their manager.  In these situations, non-exempt employees will receive pay for time off from scheduled work.  When the decision to close is made before the workday has begun, non-exempt employees will not receive pay for time off from scheduled work.  Non-exempt employees may use, with their manager’s approval, accrued and unused PTO benefits.

## Visitors in the Workplace
All visitors should enter Saleae, Inc. at the reception area.  Authorized visitors will receive directions or be escorted to their destination.  Employees are responsible for the conduct and safety of their visitors. Visits from friends and family are to be kept to a minimum, in order to preserve an appropriate work environment. It is extremely important that the impression left with Saleae, Inc. visitors is that of a professional organization with the highest standards of conduct.

## Technology Use and Security
Saleae, Inc. provides its employees with access to business systems (including but not limited to telephones, computers, software, networks, voicemail, e-mail, Company intranet, external electronic bulletin boards, wire services, on-line services, the Internet and the World Wide Web).  These systems are for use in carrying out the Company’s business.  Although Saleae, Inc. does not prohibit the use of the Company’s electronic, e-mail and voicemail systems for personal use, employees must keep in mind that the Company’s resources are being used for this service.  Employees need to demonstrate a sense of responsibility and may not abuse the privilege.  The following guidelines govern the proper use of those electronic systems and services, and set forth the Company’s policies with regard to access to, use and disclosure of data and electronic mail or voice messages sent or received.  

### E-mail and Voicemail Guidelines.
Users should be aware of the following: (a) the use of the e-mail and voicemail systems is for the conduct of business and Company -sanctioned and supported programs and activities.  Use of these systems for personal activities should be kept to a minimum; (b) common sense, courtesy and professionalism should be employed when using e-mail.  Users should not send (or forward) anything that others might find offensive.  Among material considered offensive are any messages that contain sexual implications or unwelcome personal invitations, racial slurs, gender-specific comments, or any other comments that offensively address someone’s age, sexual orientation, religious or political beliefs, national origin, disability, or any other protected characteristic; (c) because of its public nature, e-mail may be inappropriate for many types of confidential documents unless encryption technology is used.  There are significant confidentiality problems if material communicated by e-mail is copied, re-routed, diverted or wrongly addressed.  Also, commercially sensitive and “inside” information can create significant problems if e-mailed without additional protection.  

Employees may not send or receive copyrighted materials, trade secret, confidential or proprietary information, or similar materials outside of the Company without prior authorization from their manager.  Employees must take available measures to protect confidentiality; (d) anyone obtaining electronic access to other companies’ or individuals’ materials must respect all copyrights and may not copy, retrieve, modify or forward copyrighted materials except as permitted by the copyright owner or a single copy for reference use only; (e) any messages or information sent by an employee to one or more individuals via an electronic network (e.g. bulletin board, on-line service, or Internet) may constitute statements identifiable and attributable to the Company, and should be treated as such.  While some users include personal “disclaimers” in electronic messages, it should be noted that there would still be a connection with the Company, and the statement might still be legally attributed to the Saleae, Inc.; (f) employees may not use the e-mail or voicemail systems to solicit or persuade participation in, commercial ventures, religious or political causes, outside organizations, or other non-job related activities.

### Monitoring.
Saleae, Inc.’s e-mail, voicemail and computer systems are Company property.  All messages, documents and files created, sent or received on these systems are and remain the property of the Company and are not the private property of any employee.  Saleae, Inc. reserves the right to review, audit, intercept, access and disclose all documents and files on its computer systems and all messages created, sent or received over its e-mail and voicemail systems.  The contents of e-mail, voicemail, and computer files, properly obtained for legitimate business purposes, may be disclosed by the Company without the permission of the employee.  The confidentiality of any message should not be assumed.  Even when a message is erased, it is still possible to retrieve and review that message on both e-mail and voicemail systems.  Further, the use of passwords for security does not guarantee confidentiality, as the Company can obtain access to all passwords.  Upon request, all passwords must be disclosed to the Company or they will be made invalid and cannot be used.  Notwithstanding the Company’s right to retrieve and read any e-mail or voicemail messages, such messages should be treated as confidential by other employees and accessed only by the recipient.  Unless otherwise authorized by management, employees are not authorized to retrieve or read any e-mail or voicemail messages that are not sent to them.  The Company does not have any obligation to provide users with copies of personal messages (in either paper or electronic media).

### Ownership of Data.
The computer system, as well as the data and programs stored on the system, are Saleae, Inc. property, except for programs which the Company has obtained a license to use.  The Company retains ownership of all of its files, paper or electronic.  No files, electronic or otherwise, may be removed from the Company without authorization.  The Company reserves the right to access all files and data that are created or stored on its computer system, on an employee’s local personal computer, or stored in an employee’s hardcopy files.  This includes personal computers and electronic storage media (disks, removable hard drives, etc.) used at home or off-site for work-related purposes.  The Company will access files for business purposes, including but not limited to:  Retrieving missing business data in an employee’s absence; investigating possible employee theft or espionage; ensuring that Company systems are not used to violate Company policy, including to transmit discriminatory, offensive or illegal messages; ensuring that unlicensed or illegal software is not installed on any computer assigned to an employee; ensuring that Company systems are not used for the benefit of or to develop business other than the Company’s business.

### Use of Saleae, Inc.’s Computer System.
In addition, all employees must comply with the following guidelines regarding use of the Company’s computer system:

- Users must comply with all software licenses, copyrights, and all other state and federal laws governing intellectual property.
- Fraudulent, harassing, embarrassing, indecent, profane, obscene, intimidating, or other such material may not be displayed on or stored in the Company’s computers.  Users encountering or receiving such material should immediately report the incident to their manager.
-	Saleae, Inc. configures, installs and maintains the computer systems it provides to employees.  Users may not modify or attempt to modify the computer systems (including, without limitation, installing, deleting or modifying hardware or software on individual computers or the network) without first receiving explicit authorization from Company management.
-	Users are responsible for safeguarding their passwords for the system.  Individual passwords should not be printed, stored online, or given to others.  Users are responsible for all transactions made using their passwords.
-	A user’s ability to connect to other systems through the network does not imply a right to connect to those systems unless specifically authorized by the operators of those systems.

Guidelines for Responsible Internet Use.  	

Employees are not permitted to publish or access inappropriate material on the Web.

Good judgment must also be used when browsing the Web.  There is much material on the Internet that is inappropriate for the Company’s business environment.  For example, much of the Internet’s information is not pertinent to Company business, some may involve misappropriation of trade secrets of other companies, and other information may be offensive or controversial in a business setting.  This service is provided to employees as a business tool, not for excessive or inappropriate recreation or personal business.

## Workplace Violence Prevention
All employees, including Company management and temporary employees should be treated with courtesy and respect at all times.  Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, horseplay, or other conduct that may be dangerous to others.  Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of Saleae, Inc.  Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, a customer, or a member of the public at any time, including off-duty periods, will not be tolerated.  This prohibition includes threats of any kind, all acts of harassment, including harassment that is based on an individual’s sex, race, age, or any characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.

All threats of or actual violence, both direct and indirect, whether written, verbal or physical, must be reported immediately to a manager or the Human Resources Department.  This includes threats by employees, as well as threats by customers, vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public.  When reporting a threat of violence, employees should be as specific and detailed as possible.  The Company will not tolerate retaliation against any employee who reports workplace violence.

Saleae, Inc. will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats of or actual violence and of suspicious individuals or activities.  In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, Saleae, Inc. may suspend employees, either with or without pay, pending investigation.  Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of or actual violence or other conduct that is in violation of these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

Saleae, Inc. encourages employees to bring their disputes or differences with other employees to the attention of their manager or the Human Resources Department before the situation escalates into potential violence.

## Breastfeeding Policy
In recognition of the well documented health advantages of breastfeeding for infants and mothers, Saleae, Inc. will provide, upon request, a supportive environment to enable breastfeeding employees to express their milk during work hours.

Saleae, Inc. subscribes to the following worksite support policy. This policy shall be communicated to all current employees and included in new employee orientation training.

Breastfeeding employees who choose to continue providing their milk for their infants after returning to work shall receive upon request to their supervisor:

Milk Expression Breaks: Breastfeeding employees are allowed to breastfeed or express milk during work hours using their normal breaks and meal times. For time that may be needed beyond the usual break times, employees may use personal leave or may make up the time as negotiated with their supervisors.

A Place to Express Milk: A private room (not a toilet stall or restroom) shall be available for employees to breastfeed or express milk. The room will be private and sanitary, and have an electrical outlet. If employees prefer, they may also breastfeed or express milk in other comfortable, private locations agreed upon in consultation with the employee’s supervisor.

# LEAVES OF ABSENCE

## Pregnancy-Related Disability Rights (For California Employees Only)

### Leaves of Absence and Transfers
Under the California Pregnancy Disability Leave Law (“PDLL”), any employee who is disabled on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions may take a pregnancy-related disability leave for the period of actual disability of up to four (4) months, in addition to any family care or medical leave to which the employee may be entitled under the Family Care and Medical Leaves of Absence policy above. Pregnancy-related disability leaves may be taken intermittently, or on a reduced-hours schedule, as medically necessary.   There is no length of service requirement for a Pregnancy-Related Leave of Absence.

Moreover, an employee is entitled to a reasonable accommodation for pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions if she so requests and provides the Company with medical certification from her health care provider. In addition to other forms of reasonable accommodation, a pregnant employee is entitled to transfer temporarily to a less strenuous or hazardous position or to less hazardous or strenuous duties if she so requests, the transfer request is supported by proper medical certification, and the transfer can be reasonably accommodated.

### Notification Requirements
Whenever possible, an employee should submit a written request for pregnancy-related disability leave or pregnancy-related disability transfer to Human Resources as soon as she is aware of the need for such leave or transfer. If the leave or transfer is foreseeable, the employee must provide 30 calendar days' advance notice to the Company of the need for pregnancy-related disability leave or transfer. If it is not practicable for the employee to give 30 calendar days' advance notice of the need for leave or transfer, the employee must notify the Company as soon as practicable after she learns of the need for the pregnancy-related disability leave or transfer.
Any request for a pregnancy-related disability leave or transfer must be supported by medical certification from a health care provider. Upon expiration of the time period for the leave or transfer estimated by the health care provider, the Company may require the employee to provide another medical certification if additional time is requested for leave or transfer.

### Reinstatement
Unless the Company and the employee have already agreed upon the employee’s return date, an employee who has taken a pregnancy-related disability leave or transfer must notify Human Resources at least two (2) business days before her scheduled return to work or, as applicable, transfer back to her former position.  An employee who timely returns to work at the expiration of her pregnancy-related disability leave will be reinstated to her former position, or a comparable position, whenever possible and consistent with applicable law.

Each employee who has taken a pregnancy-related disability leave or transfer must be released by her doctor to return to work. The release should be in writing and submitted to Human Resources on or before the employee's return from a pregnancy-related disability leave or transfer.

### Integration with Other Benefits
An employee taking pregnancy-related disability leave may substitute accrued PTO or sick leave during her leave, but is not required to do so.  Otherwise, leave is unpaid. The substitution of paid leave for pregnancy-related disability leave does not extend the total duration of the leave to which an employee is entitled.

An employee may apply for California Disability Insurance (SDI) benefits, when she becomes disabled.  Any SDI she is eligible to receive will be integrated with any accrued PTO or sick leave the employee elects to use and any Short-Term Disability benefits for which she may be eligible, so that the employee does not receive over one hundred percent (100%) of her regular pay.

Employees on pregnancy-related disability leave will accrue employment benefits, such as PTO or sick leave, only when paid leave is being substituted for unpaid leave and only if the employee would otherwise be entitled to such accrual.

The Company will continue to pay for the employee’s participation in the Company’s group health plans to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as would apply had the employee not taken leave, up to a maximum of 4 months, regardless of whether such leave is also covered by FMLA/CFRA. Thus, the employee must continue to pay her share of the health plan premiums during the leave. If the employee substitutes paid leave for the unpaid leave, such payments will be deducted from the employee’s pay through the regular payroll deductions. Otherwise, the employee must make arrangements with the Company for the payment of such premiums. All other benefits will be governed in accordance with the terms of each benefit plan and are the sole responsibility of the employee.

## Other Disability Leaves
In addition to medical or pregnancy-related disability leaves described above, employees may take a temporary disability leave of absence if necessary to reasonably accommodate a workplace injury or a disability under the ADA or state law. Any disability leave under this section will run concurrently with any medical leave to which the employee is entitled under the FMLA, CFRA, or PDL.

Disability leaves under this section will be unpaid.

Employees taking disability leave must comply with the Family Care and Medical Leaves of Absence provisions regarding substitution of paid leaves, notice, and medical certification. For the purpose of applying these provisions, a disability leave will be considered to be a medical leave.

Unless the employee is also eligible for leave under the FMLA/CFRA, the employee will not be entitled to any continued employer contributions towards any employee benefit plan unless otherwise required by law. An employee, however, may elect to continue participating in such benefit plans, at the employee’s own expense, to the extent permitted by such plans.

The duration of a leave under this section shall be consistent with applicable law, but in no event shall the leave extend past the date on which an employee becomes capable of performing the essential functions of his or her position, with or without reasonable accommodation. For a full explanation of leave duration and reinstatement rights, employees should contact Human Resources.

If the disability leave is needed due to a work-related injury, all matters relating to an employee's leave rights, including compensation, benefits, substitution of paid leave, notice and certification requirements, and reinstatement shall be governed by state workers’ compensation laws. Employees having questions about such rights should contact Human Resources.

## Personal Leave
If a regular full-time or part-time employee is temporarily unable to work for compelling personal reasons other than those described in Saleae, Inc.’s other leave policies, the employee may apply, in writing, for an unpaid leave of absence for up to thirty (30) days.  Such applications are evaluated on an individual basis, taking into account the total circumstances of the request, including anticipated workload requirements and staffing considerations during the proposed period of absence.  Saleae, Inc. reserves the right to refuse a request for an unpaid personal leave of absence at its sole discretion.  Employees who request a personal leave of absence should make the request as soon as they become aware of the need for leave.

Employees must use any accrued PTO at the beginning of any personal leave of absence.  

For those employees who have health insurance benefits, Saleae, Inc. will continue to provide such for the full period of the approved personal leave, to be paid for by the employee.  Benefit accruals, such as PTO, or holiday benefits and any stock option vesting, will be suspended during the unpaid portion of leave and will resume upon return to active employment.

When a personal leave ends, Saleae, Inc. will endeavor to offer the employee the same position held prior to the leave, if it is available, or a similar available position for which the employee is qualified.  However, Saleae, Inc. does not guarantee that the employee will be reinstated upon expiration of personal leave.  If an employee fails to report to work promptly at the expiration of the approved leave period, Saleae, Inc. may consider the employee to have voluntarily resigned employment.

## Military Leave
The Company will grant employees a military leave of absence to the extent required by applicable federal and state law.
Employees who are reservists will continue to receive full pay while on leave for required training up to two (2) weeks annually.

## Military Spouse Leave
Employees in California who work at least an average of 20 hours per week and whose spouse or domestic partner is a member of the United States Armed Forces, National Guard, or Army Reserves on active duty in an area of military conflict are eligible to receive up to ten (10) days off from work, on an unpaid basis, during a period when his or her spouse or domestic partner is on leave from deployment during a period of military conflict, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Employees must provide notice of the unpaid leave to the Company within two (2) business days of receiving official notice that the qualifying military member will be on leave from deployment and provide written documentation certifying that the qualifying military member will be on leave from deployment during the time requested for the unpaid leave of absence. When Military Spouse leave is provided, it shall also count toward the employee’s FMLA entitlement where legally permissible.  

## Bereavement Leave
Regular full-time employees and regular part-time employees regularly scheduled to work at least 30 hours per week may request a paid leave of absence up to a maximum of three (3) consecutive working days upon the death of an immediate family member.  Members of the immediate family are defined as: the employee’s spouse, domestic partner, parent, step-parent, child, step-child, sibling or step-sibling; the employee’s spouse’s (domestic partner’s) parent, step-parent, child, step-child, sibling or step-sibling; the employee’s child’s spouse; the employee’s grandparents or grandchildren.

If an employee requires more than three days off for bereavement leave, the employee may, with their manager’s approval, use any accrued PTO, and then may request unpaid time off.

## Jury Duty
The Company will provide employees time off to serve, as required by law, on a jury or grand jury if the employee provides reasonable advance notice.

Employees will be granted a paid leave of absence of up to ten (10) business days per year for the purpose of fulfilling jury duty. Any jury duty that extends beyond 10 business days per year will be unpaid.  However, exempt employees who work any portion of a workweek in which they also serve on jury duty will receive their full salary for that workweek.  Employees may elect to substitute accrued PTO during any unpaid leave due to jury duty.

Employees are required to provide reasonable advance notice of the need for leave due to jury duty. Employees also are expected to report to work each day or portion of a day they are not performing jury/witness duty. The Company reserves the right to request that the employee furnish written verification from the court as proof that the employee served jury duty. Failure to provide written verification is grounds for disciplinary action.

## Witness Leave
The Company will provide employees with time off to appear in court or other judicial proceedings as a witness to comply with a valid subpoena or other court order. Time off for these purposes will be unpaid. However, employees may elect to substitute accrued PTO during any unpaid leave due to witness leave.

Employees are required to provide reasonable advance notice of the need for witness leave. Employees also are expected to report to work each day or portion of a day they are not performing witness duty.

## Leave for Educational/Daycare Purposes
Employees will be granted time off without pay for up to 40 hours per calendar year, but no more than eight hours in any calendar month, to participate in the activities of schools or licensed child daycare facilities attended by their children. Employees must substitute accrued PTO for purposes of a planned absence under this section.

Employees wishing to take time off under this section must provide their supervisors with reasonable notice of the planned absence. If both parents of a child are employed by the Company at the same worksite, the request for time off under this section will be granted to the first parent to provide notice of the need for time off. The request from the second parent will be accommodated if possible.

The Company reserves the right to request that the employee furnish written verification from the school or daycare facility as proof that the employee participated in school or daycare activities on the specific date and at a particular time. Failure to provide written verification is grounds for disciplinary action.

## Volunteer Firefighter, Reserve Peace Officer, and Emergency Rescue Personnel
Employees will be granted time off on an unpaid basis to perform emergency duties as a volunteer firefighter, reserve peace officer, or emergency rescue personnel. Employees who are volunteer firefighters also are eligible for unpaid leave of up to 14 days per calendar year for fire or law enforcement training.  Employees may substitute accrued PTO for any unpaid portion of leave to perform such emergency duties or training.

## Voting Time Off
Employees who do not have sufficient time outside of their regular working hours to vote in a statewide election may request time off to vote. If possible, employees should make their request at least two days in advance of the election. Up to two hours of paid time off will be provided, at the beginning or end of the employee's regular shift, whichever will allow the most free time for voting and the least time off work.

## Leave Related To Domestic Violence or Sexual Assault
The Company will provide time off to an employee who has been the victim of domestic violence or sexual assault to seek any relief, including, but not limited to, a temporary restraining order, restraining order, or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety, or welfare of the victim or his or her child. This includes time off for court proceedings, services from a domestic violence shelter, program or rape crisis center, counseling, medical attention, and participation in safety planning programs. The Company requires reasonable advance notice of the leave when feasible. If time off is taken due to an emergency, the employee must, within 15 days of the absence, provide the Company with certification of the need for the leave such as a police report, court order, documentation from a healthcare provider, victims advocate, or counselor. Employees may substitute accrued PTO during leave under this section; otherwise, leave is unpaid.

## Crime Victim’s Leave
The Company will provide time off to an employee to attend judicial proceedings related to a crime, if that employee is a victim of crime, an immediate family member of a victim, a registered domestic partner of a victim, or the child of a registered domestic partner of a victim. The Company requires that where feasible, in advance of taking leave, the employee provide it with a copy of the notice of each scheduled proceeding that is provided to the victim by the agency responsible for providing notice. If advance notice is not possible, the employee is required to provide the Company with a copy of the notice within a reasonable time. Employees may substitute accrued PTO during leave under this section; otherwise, leave is unpaid.

## Organ & Bone Marrow Donor Leave
Employees based in California may take a paid leave of absence of up to 30 business days in a one-year period for the purpose of donating his or her organ, and up to 5 business days in a one-year period for the purpose of donating his or her bone marrow. The one-year period is measured from the date the employee’s leave begins and shall consist of 12 consecutive months.  Only employees who have been employed by the Company for at least a 90-day period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave are eligible for the foregoing types of leave.

Leave may be taken in one or more periods subject to the limitations set forth above.  Before receiving payment for such leave, employees will be required to take up to 2 weeks of accrued PTO or sick leave for organ donation leave and up to 5 days of accrued PTO or sick leave for bone marrow donation leave.

In order to receive leave under this section, an employee must provide a written verification from a licensed health care provider that he or she is an organ or bone marrow donor and that there is a medical necessity for the donation.  An employee should provide Human Resources with as much advance notice as possible when scheduling this leave.

# RULES WITHIN THE WORKPLACE

## Employee Conduct and Work Rules
To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, Saleae, Inc. expects employees to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all employees and the organization.

Employees may be disciplined for misconduct, including but not limited to the following:

-	Insubordination
-	Dishonesty
-	Theft
-	Discourtesy
-	Misusing or destroying Company property or the property of another on Company premises
-	Violating conflict of interest rules
-	Disclosing or using confidential or proprietary information without authorization
-	Falsifying or altering Company records, including an application for employment or time records
-	Interfering with the work performance of others
-	Altercations
-	Harassing, including sexually harassing, employees or customers
-	Being under the influence of, manufacturing, dispensing, distributing, using, or possessing alcohol or illegal or controlled substances on Company property or while conducting Company business
-	Sleeping on the job or leaving your work location/work site without authorization
-	Possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon on Company property or while conducting Company business
-	Being convicted of a crime that indicates unfitness for the job or raises a threat to the safety or well-being of the Company, its employees, customers, or property
-	Failure to call in or report for your scheduled shift of work. An absence of three (3) consecutive scheduled workdays without notifying your manager or his or her designee is job abandonment and is considered a voluntary resignation.

Saleae, Inc. reserves the right to proceed directly to a written warning, demotion, or termination for misconduct or performance deficiency, without resort to prior disciplinary steps, when the Company deems such action appropriate.

In addition, it should be remembered that the employment relationship with Saleae, Inc. is at the mutual consent of Saleae, Inc. and the employee, and either party may terminate that relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice.  Engaging in the above-listed activities is not a condition of Saleae, Inc.’s exercise of its right to terminate the employment relationship.

## Alcohol and Drug Use
It is Saleae, Inc.’s desire to provide a drug-free, healthful, and safe workplace.  To promote this goal, Saleae, Inc. requires all employees to report to work fit to perform their jobs in a satisfactory manner and prohibits the use or possession of alcohol or illegal drugs.

While on Saleae, Inc. premises, while conducting business-related activities off Saleae, Inc. premises, while on on-call status, or while operating a vehicle that is owned or leased by the Company, no employee may use, possess, manufacture, distribute, dispense, and sell alcohol or any controlled substance or illegal drugs.  In addition, no employee may report to work or go or remain on duty or on on-call status while impaired by or under the influence of any illegal drug or alcohol.  Moderate consumption of alcohol served at Company -sponsored events will not violate this policy.  For purposes of this policy, a drug will be considered an “illegal drug” if its use is prohibited or restricted by law and an employee improperly uses or possesses the drug, regardless of whether such conduct constitutes an illegal act, or whether the employee is criminally prosecuted and/or convicted for such conduct.  The legal use of prescribed drugs is permitted on the job only if it does not impair an employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of the job effectively and in a safe manner that does not endanger the employee or other individuals in the workplace. The Company has the discretion to perform drug testing based on reasonable suspicion.

Violations of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment.  Such violations may also have legal consequences.  An employee convicted of any drug statute violation, where the offense occurred in the workplace, must notify Saleae, Inc. within five (5) days of the conviction.  Any employee convicted of such a violation will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Employees who wish to voluntarily enter and participate in an alcohol or drug rehabilitation program should contact Human Resources.  

## Sexual and Other Unlawful Harassment
We are committed to providing a work environment free of unlawful harassment.  The Company’s policy prohibits all forms of illegal harassment, including, sexual harassment or harassment based on race, religion, religious creed (includes all aspects of religious belief, observance, and practice, including religious dress and grooming practices), color, national origin (including language use restrictions), ancestry, physical and mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, denial of family and medical care leave, marital status, sex (which includes pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding and medical conditions related to pregnancy), gender, gender identity, gender expression, sex stereo type, transgender, age (40 and over), military and veteran status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, registered partner status, and any other local, state, or federal protected basis.

Employment practices within the workplace should treat all individuals equally, evaluating each on the basis of individual skills, knowledge and abilities and not on the basis of characteristics generally attributed to a group enumerated in the Act.  Such behavior is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated.  As part of its dedication to Equal Employment Opportunity, the Company is committed to maintaining a workplace which all of our employees are free to perform their jobs without being subjected to any form of unlawful discrimination or harassment.

The Company will take all reasonable steps to prevent unwanted harassment from occurring.  Sexual harassment is prohibited by the Company and is against the law.  Every employee should be aware of the following:

-	what constitutes sexual harassment;
-	what steps are to be taken if harassment occurs; and,
-	the state law prohibiting retaliation for reporting sexual harassment.

Although many people think of sexual harassment as involving a male boss and a female employee, not all sexual harassment is done by males.  It's against the law for females to sexually harass males or other females, and for males to harass other males or females.

Sexual harassment often involves any employee including but not limited to, co-workers, supervisors, owners, independent contractors, and managers, unpaid interns and volunteers, and other persons doing business with or for the Company, a non-employee, clients, guests, third parties or vendors with whom the employee comes into contact from engaging in conduct prohibited by this policy. Employees must report any complaint of harassment by a third party to a member of management immediately.

Under Federal law, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment at the occurrence of any of the following:

-	submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;
-	submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the individual; and,
-	such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

California law defines sexual harassment as:

-	Verbal harassment -- epithets, derogatory comments or slurs.  Examples:  Name-calling, belittling, sexually explicit or degrading words to describe an individual, sexually explicit jokes, comments about an employee's anatomy and/or dress, sexually-oriented noises or remarks, questions about a person's sexual practices, use of patronizing terms or remarks, verbal abuse, graphic verbal commentaries about the body.
-	Physical harassment -- assault, impeding or blocking movement, or any physical interference with normal work or movement, when directed at an individual.  Examples:  touching, pinching, patting, grabbing, brushing against or poking another employee's body, hazing or initiation that involves a sexual component, requiring an employee to wear sexually suggestive clothing.
-	Visual harassment -- derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings.  Examples:  displaying sexual pictures, writing or objects, obscene letters or invitations, staring at an employee's anatomy, leering, sexually oriented gestures, mooning, unwanted love letters or notes.
-	Sexual favors -- unwanted sexual advances which condition an employment benefit upon an exchange of sexual favors.  Examples:  continued requests for dates, any threat of demotion, termination, etc.  If requested sexual favors are not given, making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances, propositioning an individual.
-	Bullying, defined as repeated mistreatment of one or more persons (the targets) by one or more perpetrators.  It is abusive conduct that is:
  - Threatening, humiliating or intimidating, or
  - Work interference – sabotage – which prevents work from getting done, or verbal abuse;
-	Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests as a condition of continued employment, or to avoid some other loss and offers of employment benefits in return for sexual favors.

It is impossible to define every action or all words that could be interpreted as sexual harassment.  The examples listed above with the state's definition of sexual harassment are not meant to be a complete list of objectionable behavior.

If sexual harassment occurs:

-	When possible, confront the harasser and persuade him/her to stop.  The harasser may not realize the advances or behaviors are offensive.  When it is appropriate and sensible, tell the harasser the behaviors or advances are unwelcome and must stop.  Sometimes a simple confrontation ends the problem.
-	To report sexual harassment, an employee is to contact their supervisor or their Human Resources Department. Sexual harassment or retaliation should be reported immediately.  An employee must report such activities even though they were not the target of the harassment or be subject to disciplinary action.  This includes those who merely observe such actions.
-	An impartial, thorough and timely investigation will be conducted by a qualified member of management or the Human Resource Department and appropriate action will be taken including a timely closure.  The Company will promptly investigate all reported incidents of sexual harassment or retaliation, and the investigation will be kept as confidential as possible.

All allegations of harassment or retaliation will be taken seriously and will be promptly investigated, that investigation will remain as confidential as possible.  Appropriate remedial, corrective action and resolutions will be taken as warranted.  Any individual affiliated with the Company who, after the investigation, is determined to have engaged in any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in violation of this policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination.  The company will document and track all information and evidence collected in the fact finding investigative process.

All members of management and supervisor must report any complaints of misconduct to a designated company representative, such as the human resources manager, President, owner, etc. so the company can investigate the issue immediately.

If an employee is found guilty of sexual harassment they may be personally liable for monetary damages.  The Company will not pay damages assessed against an employee personally.  In addition, the Company will take disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against any employee who engages in sexual harassment.

The Company’s policy, California State law, and Federal law forbids retaliation against any employee who opposed sexual harassment, files a complaint, testifies, assists or participates in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing.

While we hope that all employees will seek the assistance and find resolution through our own internal complaint procedure, be aware that the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) is the State agency that resolves complaints of unlawful discrimination, including sexual harassment.  The Fair Employment and Housing Commission (FEHC), headquartered in San Francisco, decide cases prosecuted by the DFEH at the State level.  If you feel you have been subjected to harassment you may contact the DFEH, consult the local telephone directory under State Government Offices.

## Open Door Communication

Most importantly, we have a workplace where communications are open and problems can be discussed and resolved in a mutually respectful atmosphere taking into account individual circumstances and the individual employee. We firmly believe that by our communicating with each other directly, we can continue to resolve any difficulties that may arise and develop a mutually beneficial relationship.

Your suggestions and comments on any subject are important to us, so we encourage you to take every opportunity to discuss them with us. We are always interested in your constructive ideas and suggestions for improving our business. Your job will not be adversely affected in any way because you use the open door procedure.

If, for any reason, you feel this philosophy is not occurring in your work group, please feel free to discuss this with your manager, Human Resources, or senior management.

## Whistleblower Protection Policy
This Whistleblower Protection Policy applies to all Saleae, Inc. staff, whether full-time, part-time, or temporary employees, to all volunteers, to all who provide contract services, and to all officers and directors, each of whom shall be entitled to protection.  

A protected person shall be encouraged to report information relating to illegal practices or violations of policies of the Company (a “Violation”) that such person in good faith has reasonable cause to believe is credible.  Information shall be reported to the President (the “Compliance Officer”), unless the report relates to the Compliance Officer, in which case the report shall be made to the Board of Directors, which shall be responsible to provide an alternative procedure.

Anyone reporting a Violation must act in good faith, and have reasonable grounds for believing that the information shared in the report indicates that a Violation has occurred.  

The Compliance Officer shall promptly investigate each such report and prepare a written report to the Board of Directors.  In connection with such investigation all persons entitled to protection shall provide the Compliance Officer with credible information.  All actions of the Compliance Officer in receiving and investigating the report and additional information shall endeavor to protect the confidentiality of all persons entitled to protection.

The Organization encourages anyone reporting a Violation to identify himself or herself when making a report in order to facilitate the investigation of the Violation.  However, reports may be submitted anonymously by filling out a “Whistleblower Reporting Form” and depositing the form in the designated box. Reports of Violations or suspected Violations will be kept confidential to the extent possible, with the understanding that confidentiality may not be maintained where identification is required by law or in order to enable the Organization or law enforcement to conduct an adequate investigation.   

No person entitled to protection shall be subjected to retaliation, intimidation, harassment, or other adverse action for reporting information in accordance with this Policy.  Any person entitled to protection who believes that he or she is the subject of any form of retaliation for such participation should immediately report the same as a violation of and in accordance with this Policy.

Any individual within the Organization who retaliates against another individual who has reported a Violation in good faith or who, in good faith, has cooperated in the investigation of a Violation is subject to discipline, including termination of employment or volunteer status.

## Attendance and Punctuality
To maintain a productive work environment, Saleae, Inc. expects employees to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work.

Absence includes (without limitation) an employee’s absence from the workplace when the employee is expected to be present and absence from meetings (on or off-site) when the employee’s attendance is required.

If employees cannot avoid being late to work or are unable to work or attend a meeting as scheduled, they should notify their manager as soon as possible in advance of the anticipated absence or tardiness.  Employees must notify their manager of an absence or tardiness no later than their scheduled work start time, or the time required to be present at a meeting, or the absence or tardiness may be considered unexcused.  Absent extenuating circumstances, employees must call in on any day they are scheduled to work and will not report to work.

Excessive unexcused absences or tardiness will not be tolerated. In general, two (2) unexcused absences in a ninety (90) day period or a consistent pattern of unexcused absences or tardiness will be considered excessive.  Excessive unexcused absences and tardiness are disruptive to Saleae, Inc. and will subject an employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

## Personal Appearance
During business hours or when representing Saleae, Inc., employees are expected to present a clean, neat, and tasteful appearance.  Employees should dress and groom themselves according to the requirements of their position and accepted professional standards.  This is particularly true if an employee’s job involves dealing with customers or visitors in person.

## Return of Property
Employees are responsible for all Saleae, Inc. property, including equipment, materials, or written information issued to them or in their possession or control.  All Saleae, Inc. property must be returned by employees on or before their last day of work, and employees may not retain any Saleae, Inc. property or copies thereof.

## Workplace Inspections
In order to assure access at all times to Company property, and because employees properly in possession of Company property or information related to Company business may not always be available to produce the property or information when needed in the ordinary course of the Company’s business, the Company reserves the right to conduct a routine inspection or search at any time without notice for Company property on Company premises. “Company premises” includes all premises and locations owned or leased by the Company or under the control of the Company, including parking lots, lockers, and storage areas. Routine searches or inspections for Company property may include an employee’s office, desk, file cabinet, closet, computer files, voice mail, electronic mail, or similar places where employees may store Company property or Company -related information, whether or not the places are locked or protected by access codes and/or passwords. Because even a routine search for Company property might result in the discovery of an employee's personal possessions, all employees are encouraged to refrain from bringing into the workplace any item of personal property that they do not wish to reveal to the Company.

In addition, Saleae, Inc. wishes to maintain a work environment that is free of illegal drugs, alcohol, firearms, explosives, or other improper materials.  To this end, Saleae, Inc. prohibits the possession, transfer, sale, or use of such materials on its premises. Inspections or searches for prohibited materials in or on Company premises also will be conducted whenever the Company has reasonable suspicion to believe that a particular employee may be in possession of materials in violation of Company policy. Inspections or searches for prohibited materials may be conducted by an independent security service or by Company personnel.

## Solicitation and Distribution
In an effort to ensure a productive work environment, persons not employed by Saleae, Inc. may not solicit, or distribute literature in the workplace at any time for any purpose.  Saleae, Inc. recognizes that employees may have interests in events and organizations outside the workplace.  However, employees may not distribute literature or solicit concerning these activities during working time (working time does not include lunch periods, rest breaks, or any other periods in which employees are not on duty).

In addition, the posting of written solicitations on Company bulletin boards is prohibited.  Bulletin boards are reserved for official Company communications. All postings on Company bulletin boards must receive prior approval from management.

## Discipline
Saleae, Inc. expects high quality work from each of its employees, and expects employees to conduct themselves in a businesslike manner.  In some cases, Saleae, Inc. may choose to discipline an employee for inappropriate conduct, or poor job performance, rather than immediately terminate the employment relationship.  However, there is no set pattern that discipline must follow, and Saleae, Inc. at all times reserves the right to terminate employment without notice or warning.

Discipline may take the form of an oral warning, followed by one or more Written Warnings, at management’s discretion. Some cases may warrant immediate suspension (with or without pay), or immediate termination of employment, at management’s discretion, without any prior verbal or written warning.

## Use of Phone and Mail Systems
Employees may be required to reimburse Saleae, Inc. for any charges resulting from their personal use of the telephone.
The use of Saleae, Inc.-paid postage for personal correspondence is not permitted.

## Use of Equipment
Employees may be required to use Company property to conduct Saleae, Inc. business.  This includes computers, laptops, cell phones, and anything else necessary to perform the duties assigned.  This applies to equipment used on Company property, at a client’s place of work, or in an individual’s home.

When using Company property, employees are expected to exercise care, perform required maintenance, and follow all operating instructions, safety standards, and guidelines.  Employees must notify their managers if any equipment, machines, or tools appear to be damaged, defective, or in need of repair.  

## Business Travel Expenses
Saleae, Inc. will reimburse employees for reasonable business travel expenses incurred while on assignments away from the normal work location in accordance with Saleae, Inc.’s then current corporate travel policies.

## Telecommuting
Telecommuting is a work alternative that Saleae, Inc. in its sole discretion may offer to some employees when it would benefit both the organization and the employee.  The decision to approve a telecommuting arrangement will be based on factors such as position, job duties, performance history, related work skills, Saleae, Inc.’s business needs and the impact on the organization.  Saleae, Inc. reserves the sole discretion to refuse to make telecommuting available to an employee, or to terminate or modify a telecommuting arrangement, at any time.

The employee’s compensation, benefits, work status, work responsibilities, and the amount of time the employee is expected to work per day or per pay period will not change due to telecommuting by the employee (unless otherwise agreed upon in writing).  The employee’s telecommuting work hours will conform to a schedule agreed upon by the employee and his or her manager.  If such a schedule has not been agreed upon, the employee’s work hours will be assumed to be the same as they were before the employee began telecommuting.  Changes to this schedule must be reviewed and approved by the employee’s manager.

During working hours, the employee’s at-home work-space will be considered an extension of Saleae, Inc.’s work- space.  Therefore, workers’ compensation benefits may be available for job-related accidents that occur in the employee’s at-home work-space during working hours.  All job-related accidents will be investigated immediately.  Saleae, Inc. assumes no responsibility for injuries occurring in the employee’s at-home work-space outside the agreed-upon work hours or which do not occur in the course of performing legitimate job-related duties.  The employee agrees to maintain safe conditions in the at-home work-space and to practice the same safety habits and follow the same Company safety rules as those followed on Company’s premises.  In the case of an injury while working at home, the employee should immediately report the injury to his or her manager or the Human Resources Department.

## Driving and Cell Phone Use
If your work requires that you drive your own vehicle, you must be covered by your own insurance carrier. Employees are also responsible for any moving violations and fines which may result when operating a vehicle for business. The use of seat belts is mandatory for employees and passengers while driving for business.

In the interest of the safety of our employees and other drivers, Saleae, Inc. employees are prohibited from using cell phones while driving on Company business and/or Company time. If your job requires that you keep your cell phone turned on while you are driving, you must use a hands-free device and you should safely pull off the road before conducting Company business. The Company prohibits employees from placing phone calls while operating a motor vehicle, driving on Company business and/or Company time. However, the law of the particular state in which an employee is driving supersedes this policy if it is more restrictive.  

Writing, sending, or reading text-based communication – including text messaging, instant messaging, and e-mail – on a wireless device or cell phone while driving is also prohibited under this policy. Violating this policy is a violation of law beginning January 1, 2009 and a violation of Saleae, Inc. rules.
